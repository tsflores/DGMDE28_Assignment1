        <p>
          My name is Trinidad, and I recently enrolled in DGMD E-28 through the Harvard Extension School. Here's a little
          information about me to get you started. Of course, if you're interested in learning more or following my
          exploits, please sign up for my newsletter. It's published monthly. You won't be disappointed.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> I was born and raised in a small town in Northwest Ohio</li>
          <li> As a kid, I loved math and chemistry so what better way to merge the two than pursuing a degree in
            Chemical Engineering</li>
          <li> I attended MIT where I recevied a BS in Math and a BS in Chemical Engineering</li>
          <li> Later in my career, I attended the University of Michigan and recevied an MBA</li>
          <li> As you can see from the images on the left, my favorite activity is cycling and my favorite restaurant /
            sports bar is <a href="https://cherrystreetbrewing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cherry
              Street Brewing</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p> I've spent the last 30 years of my career in various engineering and finance related positions that span
          technology, insurance, and healthcare. As I near retirement, I wanted to explore thngs that have always
          interested me. During the Fall 2023 semester, I took CSCI E-12 Fundamentals of Website Development. I
          thoroughly enjoyed the class and decided to continue deepening my knowledge and expanding my skills by taking
          DGMD E-28.</p>
        <p> Throughout my career, I've dabbled in various programming languages but would not consider myself an expert
          in any one language. I have experience in object-oriented programming as well as scripting languages but do
          need to rely on resources from time to time to refresh my memory on syntax. Most of my experience is in R,
          Python, and Visual Basic.</p>
